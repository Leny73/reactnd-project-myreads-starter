# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

MyReads is a Book tracking application which was build for the final assessment project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree, React Fundamentals [link](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). This is an interactive digital library that lets you track the books that you have read, want to read and currently reading. You can search and organise your favourite books in your digital library.


## Installation
* clone the repository with `git clone`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install` in the project directory
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Usage
 
_You can search for Books pressing the + button on the bottom of the screen or navigating to appname/search._
_You can put the books in your library from the search page directly into your digital library_


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
